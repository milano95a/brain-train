									<h>WATERMELON</h>
									<br><img class="image" src="1.jpg" >
										<p> Watermelon was recently found to have high concentrations of antioxidants, including lycopene, which 
											may help prevent cognitive decline. It also offers a strong complement of beta-carotene. It's important to 
											note that to get the most concentrated nutrients, the flesh must be fully red and ripe.</p>

									<h>CHICKEN</h>
									<br><img class="image" src="3.jpg" >
										<p> Many people are surprised to hear that chicken has brain health benefits. But chicken is a great dietary 
											source of vitamins B6 and B12, as well as choline?all of which play an important role in brain health and 
											neuroprotection.</p>

							<tr><td>
							<h>SEAWEED</h>
									<br><img class="image" src="2.jpg" >
										<p>A growing body of evidence [1] suggests that regular intake of seaweed may offer brain benefits. First, 
											seaweed is a vegetarian source of those brain-boosting DHA Omega-3 fatty acids found in salmon and 
											other cold-water fish. It also has a lot of folic acid, which is an important brain nutrient from conception 
											to old age. It also contains a lot of dietary magnesium, which is a key nutrient for reducing stress and 
											protecting the body and brain from the negative effects of stress, and is also rich in lignans, which  are 
											associated with better cognitive performance in post-menopausal women.</p>

							<tr><td>
							<h>QUINOA</h>
									<br><img class="image" src="4.jpg" >
										<p>Protein-rich quinoa contains all of the essential amino acids, especially lysine, which may play a key 
											role in regulating stress and anxiety. It also contains antioxidants and a small amount of Omega-3 fatt
											acids.</p>

							<tr><td>
							<h>MILK</h>
									<br><img class="image" src="5.jpg" >
										<p>We know it does a body good, but how about a brain? A  large Australian study [2] found that participants 
											who consumed dairy products at least once per day had significantly higher scores on multiple domains 
											of cognitive function compared with those who never or rarely consumed dairy foods, adjusting for 
											cardiovascular risk factors, lifestyle and dietary factors. They also found that, in general, "?frequent 
											dairy food intake is associated with better cognitive performance but underlying causal mechanisms are 
											still to be determined." In other words, people who consume more dairy do better than non-dairy 
											consumers, but it's not 100% clear why.</p>
