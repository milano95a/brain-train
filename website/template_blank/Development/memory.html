											These simple techniques enhance your memorizing skills
										</h1>
										<h> Repeat  </h>
										<br><hr width="100%">
										<p>
											One of the golden rules of learning and memory is repeat, repeat, repeat. The brain also responds to novelty so repeating something in a different way or at a different time will make the most of the novelty effect and allow you to build stronger memories. Examples of using repletion include:
											
											
												
														<br><p>*Taking notes.</p>
												
												
														<br><p>	*Repeating a name after you hear it for the first time.</p>
												
												
														<br><p>	*Repeating or paraphrasing what someone says to you.</p>
												
											
										</p>
									</td>
								</tr>
								
								<tr>
									<td> 										
										<h> Organize  </h>
										<br><hr width="100%">
										<p>
											A day planner or smart phone calendar can help you keep track of 
											appointments and activities and can also serve as a journal in which 
											you write anything that you would like to remember. Writing down and 
											organizing information reinforces learning.
											
											
												
														<br><p>*Try jotting down conversations, thoughts, experiences.</p>
												
											
														<br><p>	*Review current and previous day's entries at breakfast and dinner.</p>
										
											
														<br><p>	*If you use a planner and not a smart phone, keep it in the same spot at home and 
														take it with you whenever you leave.</p>

										<h> Visualize  </h>
										<br><hr width="100%">
										<p>
											Learning faces and names is a particularly hard task for most people. 
											In addition to repeating a person's name, you can also associate 
											the name with an image. Visualization strengthens the association 
											you are making between the face and the name.<br><br>
											
											For example:
											Link the name Sandy with the image of a beach, and imagine Sandy on the beach.

										<h>  Group  </h>
										<br><hr width="100%">
										<p>
											When you're trying to remember a long list of items, 
											it can help to group the items in sets of three 
											to five, just as you would to remember a phone number. 
											This strategy capitalizes on organization and building associations, 
											and helps to extend the capacity of our short-term memory by chunking 
											information together instead of trying to remember each piece of information independently.
											<br><br>
											
											For example:
											If you have a list of 15 things on your grocery list, 
											you can group the items by category, such as dairy, produce, canned goods, and frozen foods.
