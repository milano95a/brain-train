									<p>Read the article first, or go right to the concentration exercises below. These are mental exercises that will strengthen the power of your mind.
The Power of Concentration - Practicing Concentration Exercises

Sharpening the needle of concentration requires practice, like everything else in life.

Do you go to the gym? If you do, how many times a week, and for how long?

Have you studied a foreign language? If you did, for how long did you practice, until you had a basic knowledge of the language?

It is the same with developing your concentration. You need training and practice. Even only ten minutes a day of concentration exercises will do you good.

Your mind does not like discipline, and will resist your efforts to discipline it. It loves its freedom more than anything else, and won't let you master it. It will make you forget to do the exercises, tempt you to postpone performing them, or make you feel too lazy. It will find many tricks to occupy your attention with something else.

The choice is yours, to be mastered by the mind and its whims, or to be its master.

Below, you will find a few simple concentration exercises. By practicing mental exercises, you train the mind and master it, and put it in its proper place, as your servant, and not as your boss and master.

You are not the mind, nor the thoughts that pass through it. Though it might be hard to accept this idea, the mind is not you, the real you, but only a tool that you use. It is an instrument, which has great value, but it has to be taught to obey you.

Most people believe that they are the mind, and erroneously believe that controlling the mind means holding themselves back and denying their freedom. They feel that controlling their mind is not natural, and that it is some sort of repression. These beliefs are not correct.

The proof that we are not the mind comes with training. Accept the idea in theory, and in time, as your control over your thoughts grows, you will know it as a fact. In reality, you, the real you, is the one mastering the mind. It is not the mind mastering itself.
Advice for Practicing the Concentration Exercises

Find a place where you can be alone and undisturbed. If you wish, you may sit crossed legged on the floor, but most people would find it more comfortable to sit on a chair. Sit with your spine erect.

Take a few calm deep breaths and then relax your body, by directing your attention to it, and relaxing each muscle, from head to toe.

Practice each of the exercises below for about 10 minutes, and after a few weeks of training, lengthen the time to 15 minutes.

Start with the first exercise. Practice it every day, until you are able to do it without any distractions or forgetfulness, and without thinking about anything else, for at least three continuous minutes.

Every time you get distracted, start again, until the 10 or 15 minutes pass away.

You have to be honest with yourself, and proceed to the next one, only after you are convinced that you have practiced it correctly and with full concentration.

There is no timetable, since this could be frustrating. If, for example, I tell you to practice a certain exercise for a specific number of days, two things might happen. You might get disappointed, if you cannot get the desired concentration within the allotted time period. You might also proceed to the next exercise, without practicing correctly the previous one.

Mastering the exercises successfully can take days, weeks, months and sometimes even more.

Put your whole attention into the exercises, and do not think about anything else. Be careful not to fall asleep, daydream or think about other matters. The moment you find yourself thinking about something else, stop the exercise and start again. After you become proficient, lengthen the time, and if possible, include another session in the afternoon.

Do not attempt too much at the beginning, and don't try to perform them all at once. Go slowly, without overdoing them or tensing your brain.

If you find it too difficult, or thoughts distract you and make you think about other matters, don't despair. Everyone encounters difficulties along the way. If you persevere and never give up, in spite of difficulties and disturbances, success will crown your efforts. Remember, even those with powerful concentration had to exercise their minds.

											Take a fruit, an apple, orange, banana or any other fruit, and hold it in your hands.<br>
											<br>

											Examine the fruit from all its sides, while keeping your whole attention focused on it. 
											Do not let yourself be carried away by irrelevant thoughts that might arise, or thoughts 
											about the grocery where you bought the fruit, how and where it was grown, its nutritive 
											value, etc. Stay calm, ignoring, and showing no interest in these thoughts.

											Just look at the fruit, focus your attention on it without thinking about anything else, and 
											examine its shape, smell, taste and the sensation it gives you when you touch it.
